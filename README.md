# TinDog

Project from the Complete 2020 Web Development Course - Angela Yu | Udemy

This simple HTML/CSS project was my first ever experience with UI/UX and the Bootstrap framework.

Although I did not come up with the style, I learned a lot about clean code, UI/UX design and integrating the bootstrap framework into a project.
